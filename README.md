# Koorst

### Description

The Koorst project is website created for the purpose of showing my skills, qualifications and projects.

### Prerequisites

Step by step instructions on how to use the application

# starts as a mode of development
$ npm run serve

# This startup is typically used when
# sending the final files to the server

# necessary
$ npm run build

#  configuration file use this command
$ npm run lint

```

### KoorstAPI

As KoorstAPI is a private Koorst API so it can only be used by Koorst but for experiences it is open, it has some endepoints:

```bash
# Base URL = https://koorst-api.vercel.app/api/

# There are a total of 4 endpoints

# home
# sobre
# projetos
# contato

# then for your use build the following URL

# baseURL/${endpoint}

# to see this worked melho go in the
# mixins mixins.js

```

If you want to create an API similar to this I recommend the channel video [Scott Spence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPLrHMGYpq4).
